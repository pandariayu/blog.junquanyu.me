## Objective of Retrospective

Talk about the process of doing the work in the sprint and focus on things like communication, teamwork, and other things outside of the actual work done.

## What went well

- Team communication and task distribution were good
    
- Team members were active
    
- Deliverables at the end of the sprint were good quality
    
- Good attendance at supervisor meetings and client meetings
    

## What didn’t go well

- The client meeting could have been more focused 
    
- Skipped a few sprint ceremonies like planning and review (We just weren’t aware it had already started)
    

## What could be improved:

- Make sure that the client stays on track
    
- Ask more focused questions for client
    
- Keep on track of meeting timings (e.g. do sprint meetings on time and client meetings when necessary)
    
- Still could have more people at supervisor meetings
