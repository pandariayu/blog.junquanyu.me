### **Question 2 (10 pts)**

A) Explain Amdahl's law and discuss the challenges of its practical implementation.

B) The actual performance as experienced by users of shared-access HPC facilities such as the Edward cluster at the University of Melbourne can vary â€“ where here performance can be considered as the throughput of jobs, i.e. from the time of first job submission to the time of last job completion. Explain why this can happen.

C) Explain how the Edward cluster has been set up to minimize this. 

D) Explain what users can do to optimize their throughput (use) of the Edward cluster.
